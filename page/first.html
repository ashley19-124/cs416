    Founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, Microsoft was created to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, 
    a microcomputer created in 1974. Currently, it is multinational corporation that is ubiquitous in the tech world. It is known for its
    variety of iconic products from software to hardware, including the Windows OS, Microsoft Office Suite, Edge web browser, Xbox, and
    much more.

    From its initial public offering (IPO) in 1986, Microsoft's share price has increased from just $0.06 to almost $360 in April 2025. However,
    this journey was in no way smooth; from scandals with the US government to poor business decisions, Microsoft has had its fair share of
    difficulty. Despite that, it has remained a staple of the modern tech scene and will continue to be for years to come.
